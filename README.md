    - "MOV": "0000000000000001"<br />
    - "RAM_WRITE": "0000000000000010"<br />
    - "RAM_WRITE_REG": "0000000000000011"<br />
    - "RAM_READ": "0000000000000100"<br />
<br />
 Currently Contains The Following Registers:<br />
 Registers:<br />
    - "A": "0000000000000001" -> 1<br />
    - "B": "0000000000000010" -> 2<br />
    - "C": "0000000000000011" -> 3<br />
